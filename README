runsim
This is a program that will fork off processes from a program called testsim. They will run for a specified number of seconds and then terminate. The user will specify when running runsim how many concurrent processes to allow with the switch -n.

USAGE:
./runsim -n # < testing.data

the # is the number of processes to allow to run at once
testing.data is the name of the given sample file containing the input for testsim.

The testsim input is of the format:
./testsim sleep_time repeat_factor

Each time testsim is run, it will sleep for sleep_time seconds, print to the screen, and then repeat repeat_factor times.

To compile the program, simply run:
make all

And to clean up the directory, run:
make clean
